@ZoltanVeres sent a long list of possible actions to help AR.js.
We need to sort out the list and get started on it :)

# TODO
- add the caniuse embed for AR.js compatibility to reduce the 'Does ar.js works on X' 
  - [getUserMedia](http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream) for the webcan
  - [WebGL](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl) for webgl - It is supported everywhere tho... im not sure we need to full embed view. Maybe just a link.
  - This embed requires to have an actual web page, not possible with markdown on github
- ```arjs.org``` is the official domain for ar.js - move content there
- arjs-cli: have a standalone client for scaffoldin
  - yeoman is a generic configurable tool maintained by google - http://yeoman.io/
  - vuejs client - seems coded as standalone https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli
  - i like yeoman which make it rather simple to create all options - we do less
  - i like the ```npm install -g arjs-cli``` - maybe to handle that and to have yeoman in the back ? thus arjs-cli API remains constant even if we move on another backend (not yeoman)

# DONE
- created [meeting-notes repository](https://github.com/ARjs-org/meeting-notes)
