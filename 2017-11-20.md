@ZoltanVeres sent a long list of possible actions to help AR.js.
We need to sort out the list and get started on it :)

# TODO
- add the caniuse embed for AR.js compatibility to reduce the 'Does ar.js works on X' 
  - [getUserMedia](http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream) for the webcan
  - [WebGL](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl) for webgl - It is supported everywhere tho... im not sure we need to full embed view. Maybe just a link.
  - This embed requires to have an actual web page, not possible with markdown on github

# DONE
- created [meeting-notes repository](https://github.com/ARjs-org/meeting-notes)
